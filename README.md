# vendingMachine
## Build and Run
To build the code, we use Gradle in the directory vendingMachine:

`gradle build`

Before we run, we must install using:

`gradle install`

And findally:

`.\build\install\vendingMachine\bin\vendingMachine.bat`

The above line calls a batch file for windows, so do run this on windows from the command line. CMD prompt or powershell works fine.
## Testing
Just input:
`gradle clean test`
Alternatively, you can view the idex.html in `\build\reports\tests\test` in your webbrowser.
